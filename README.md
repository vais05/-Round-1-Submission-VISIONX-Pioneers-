# Reflection Removal Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on processing images to remove reflections effectively. It uses image processing and computer vision techniques to isolate and eliminate reflections from an original image while preserving the core image details.

---

## Files in the Project

1. **ref_R.ipynb**: 
   - This Jupyter notebook contains the code for the reflection removal process.
   - Includes preprocessing, image transformation, and reflection suppression techniques.
   - Uses libraries like OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

2. **modelTest.ipynb**: 
   - A complementary notebook for testing and evaluating the trained model or the reflection removal algorithm.
   - May include model accuracy metrics, test datasets, and performance visualizations.

3. **OUTPUT.png**: 
   - An image file showcasing the results of the reflection removal process.
   - It includes a comparison of the original image with reflection and the processed image without reflection.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or later
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Libraries:
  - OpenCV
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - TensorFlow/PyTorch (if applicable)

Install the dependencies with:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
```

## How to Run

1. **Preparation**:
   - Ensure all files are in the same directory.
   - Open the `ref_R.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.

2. **Execution**:
   - Run all cells in the `ref_R.ipynb` notebook sequentially.
   - The script processes the input image, removes reflections, and outputs a processed image.

3. **Testing**:
   - Use the `modelTest.ipynb` notebook for additional testing and evaluation.

---

## Output
- The `OUTPUT.png` file demonstrates the results:
  - **Left**: Original image with reflections.
  - **Right**: Processed image with reflections removed.

---

## Results
The reflection removal algorithm successfully suppresses unwanted reflections while retaining the integrity of the original image. The results are visualized for qualitative analysis.

---

## Notes
- Ensure that the input images have sufficient contrast between the reflection and the actual image.
- This project assumes the use of static images. Adapting the algorithm for video or real-time processing may require further optimizations.
